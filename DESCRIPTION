Description: randomForestSRCHurdleNB is a method for estimating the mean parameter and overdispersion of a count response using a set of covariates. 
In this approach, a random forest tree is constructed with a novel splitting rule so that the best split is the 
one maximizing the likelihood of child nodes among all allowable splits. 
'randomForestSRCHurdleNBF' uses 'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022) <https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC> 
by freezing at the version 3.1.0.The custom splitting rule feature is utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule. 
In this package two types of split rules have been developed for handling count data: Split custom 1, tailored for count responses following a Poisson distribution,
and Split custom 2, designed for count responses following a Negative Binomial distribution. 
The methodology is detailed in Mathlouthi et al. (2020) < doi: 10.1177/0962280219888741> and Masaebi et al. (2024).
