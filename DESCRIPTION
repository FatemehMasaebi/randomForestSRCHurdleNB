Description: randomForestSRCHurdleNB is a method for estimating the mean parameter and overdispersion of a count response using a set of covariates. In this approach, a random forest tree is constructed with a novel splitting rule so that the best split maximizes the likelihood of child nodes among all allowable splits. 'randomForestSRCHurdleNB' utilizes the 'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022) available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC with version 3.1.0. The custom splitting rule feature is employed to implement the proposed splitting rule. This package introduces two types of split rules for handling count data: Split custom 1, tailored for count responses following a Poisson distribution, and Split custom 2, designed for count responses following a Negative Binomial distribution. The methodology is elaborated in Mathlouthi et al. (2020) doi:10.1177/0962280219888741 and Masaebi et al. (2024).
