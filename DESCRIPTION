Description: randomForestSRCHurdleNB is a method for estimating the mean parameter and overdispersion of a count response using a set of covariates. 
In this approach, a random forest tree is constructed with a novel splitting rule so that the best split is the 
one maximizing the likelihood of chil dnodes among all allowable splits. 
'randomForestSRCHurdleNBF' uses 'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2022) <https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForestSRC> 
by freezing at the version 3.1.0.The custom splitting rule feature is utilised to apply the proposed splitting rule. 
Two types of split rules have been developed for this purpose: Split custom 1, tailored for count responses following a Poisson distribution,
and Split custom 2, designed for count responses following a Negative Binomial distribution. 
The methodology is detailed in Mathlouthi et al. (2020) < doi: 10.1177/0962280219888741> and Masaebi et al. (2024). 
The 'randomForestSRC' package implements 'OpenMP' by default, contingent upon the support provided by 
the target architecture and operating system.
